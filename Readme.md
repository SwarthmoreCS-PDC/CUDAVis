# An OpenGL Library for CUDA Visualization

This code allows provides an easy to use [GPUDisplayData](myOpenGLlib.h) class that helps users visualize data processed by CUDA kernels. Tested on CUDA 8.0 and OpenGL 4.0, the code should work on modern NVIDIA graphics hardware/software combinations.

# Requirements

  * An CUDA capable NVIDIA graphics card
  * [CUDA libraries](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
  * OpenGL
  * [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
  * [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
  * [cmake](https://cmake.org/)

  Many of these can be installed through your package manager, e.g., `apt-get, yum, port, brew`.

# Quick Build Directions

This project uses `cmake` to compile files in a separate `build` directory.

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
./simple
./ripple
./julia
```

After creating the `build` directory and running `cmake` once, you should only need to run `make -j8` in the build directory if you modify the files.
